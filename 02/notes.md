# Notes

- There are only 9 unique combinations of rock-paper-scissors choices
- Each combination has a constant score value

=> Just count the frequencies of each combination and multiply with their score

- Even with the updated rules, it's just a different set of scores

Fun-Fact:

- As the points for winning and drawing are multiples of the possible choices (three!), the score values are consecutive.
